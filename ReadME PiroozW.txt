Responsive Portfolio

Created website with three pages. One about me section, a gallery of some pictures I have--will eventually 
be a real porftolio, and a contact form.  All pages are responsive and change layout depending on 
how big the window is including the navbar, pictures and text. Contact form is more for show than a 
functional form, all other links work.  Clicking on the pictures in the portfolio should show picture
in original scale.

Still feel like the grid system I set up is a bit rough and could be more fleshed out however it fulfills the
requirements as far as I know.

Thanks
